# A re-creation of my own mobile phone

This is an ongoing project I am constantly adding to

I started this project whilst working away in London painting & decorating. It gave me something to recreate just using my laptop.....and it's turned into so much more. I will use this project to showcase my skills in CSS and sokme functionality using Javascript and API's.

# CSS

The CSS for this project is very intensive, when I started I had everything on one page, which I now know is not the way to do things. So I have now split things up inot seperate files that correspond the html file in question.

- Learnings.
  Iv'e learnt alot about positioning of elements, layouts and links within HTML.

# Javascript & Fucntionality

Currently the only bit of Javascript is the clock, that works fine. Some things I plan on adding/am currently working on

- API for the weather, so it displays correct
- some kind of functionality in the google search bar
- a lock screen when the "button" on the side of the phone is pressed, with a pin to open it
- A modal that pops up with some instructions and information about the site
